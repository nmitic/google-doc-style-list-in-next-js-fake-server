This is a [JSON server mock api](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Getting Started
### Please note
- Make sure that no process is running on the port :4000
- It should run on latest version of NodeJS but I was using v18.17.0
Install dependencies and run the development server:

Run the following commands (npm, yarn should also work but I am using pnpm)

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm rnu start
```

## Why JSON server?
- I needed something quick to setup and serve data with little hustle in order to complete the project features
- It gives out of the box pagination features which I was in a need for


Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.
